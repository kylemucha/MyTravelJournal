# My Travel Journal

A simple static web page built to practice the use of props in React. Using props, I was able to display a basic travel journal using dynamic components that are imported from a database.

# React Concepts Learned

- Why Reusability is important

  - Reusability is important because it is more common to have reusable components that are driven by data than having lots of hardcoded data displayed on a screen. It makes more sense for scalability and to plan for future development and data.

- Props

  - Props are a great way to be able to build these React components and use them dynamically and reuse components when needed through the use of data.

- Create Componenets from an Array of Data

  - I was able to get hands-on experience with handling data and being able to create components that will display that data using props in React. Although I was using a file with all the data being handled in the project, I learned that this job would more often be used by calling in data from an API.
